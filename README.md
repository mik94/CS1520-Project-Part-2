# CS1520-Project-Part-2

Things I changed:

1) Used JavaScript in combination with a Twitter widget to add a Twitter Feed to the main page
2) Added links to Twitter page & Youtube page
3) Made some stylistic improvments (added fade in/fade out transition to navigation menu)
4) Used jQuery in combination with the YouTube iFrame API to implement a much simpler system of adding content to the site
    --able to reduce a lot of repeated code
